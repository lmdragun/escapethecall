# Escape the Call
## Javascript Game Under Construction
You just got home from a long day of work and your phone buzzes--you look down and with a sinking feeling realize you have to answer: It's your mom. But no matter how hard you try to keep the call short, she just keeps talking and talking.

Escape the Call is a browser game where you have to choose the right response to Your Mom's phone call and get off the call in time for important activities such as sleeping and work, eventually there will be the ability to gain points you can spend on gifts to placate your mom or tools to make the calls go faster.

The CSS is obnoxiously 90s, so be warned for some moving gifs.
